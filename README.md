Examples of use:

Address1: 10 POLY, 5 DAI, 4 ETH
Address2: 10 POLY, 5 DAI, 4 ETH
Address3: 0 POLY, 0 DAI, 0 ETH

Address 1 wants to deposit POLY for Address3:
  1. Fill amount=2, receiver Address3
  2. Click approve and submit transaction
  3. Click deposit
Now TimeLockContract has 2 POLY locked for 2 minutes (default), which can be claimed by Address3 after that time

Address 2 wants to deposit ETH for Address3:
  1. Fill amount=0.0003, receiver Address3
  2. Click deposit
Now TimeLockContract has 0.0003 ETH locked for 2 minutes (default), which can be claimed by Address3 after that time


Later, Address3 enters the app and can see a list of deposits granted for him. Each deposit has a `Claim deposit` button only visible if unlock time passed.
Address3 can claim tokens / ETH using meta transactions without paying gas fees.
